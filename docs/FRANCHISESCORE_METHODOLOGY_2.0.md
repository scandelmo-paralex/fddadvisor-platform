# FranchiseScore™ Methodology 2.0

**Version:** 2.0  
**Last Updated:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** Production - Active

---

## Overview

FranchiseScore™ 2.0 is an objective, expert-validated methodology for evaluating franchise opportunities based solely on Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) data. The scoring system awards 0-600 points across four critical dimensions that experts agree predict franchise success and buyer satisfaction.

### Key Principles

1. **FDD-Only Analysis** - All scores derived exclusively from Items 1-23 of the FDD
2. **Neutral Language** - Factual, quantitative descriptions without subjective characterizations
3. **Expert-Validated** - Based on guidance from FTC, SBA, Franchise Business Review, and industry analysts
4. **Absolute Rubric** - No competitive benchmarking; each franchise scored independently
5. **Transparent Calculations** - All scoring formulas and rationale clearly documented

---

## Scoring Structure

**Total Possible Score:** 600 points

| Dimension | Points | Focus |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Financial Transparency | 150 | Disclosure quality and financial openness |
| System Strength | 150 | Franchisor stability and system health |
| Franchisee Support | 150 | Training, operational support, and territory protection |
| Business Foundation | 150 | Management experience and franchisee success indicators |

---

## Dimension 1: Financial Transparency (150 points)

*Critical for informed decision-making and buyer confidence*

### A. Item 19 Quality (90 points max)

Evaluates the comprehensiveness of financial performance disclosures.

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **90 points:** Full Item 19 with detailed data
  - System-wide averages AND median performance
  - Distribution of results (quartiles or percentile breakdowns)
  - Sample sizes clearly stated
  - Multiple performance metrics (revenue, profit, expenses)
  
- **48 points:** Partial Item 19 with limited data
  - Limited data points (only averages OR medians)
  - Only top performers shown
  - Minimal sample size or unclear sample
  - Single performance metric
  
- **0 points:** No Item 19 provided

**Rationale:** The FTC, SBA, and all industry experts cite Item 19 as the most important FDD disclosure. It enables buyers to make informed financial decisions with real performance data rather than marketing claims.

**Neutral Language Requirements:**
- ❌ "Impressive financial disclosure"
- ✅ "Item 19 provides data for 87 outlets including median gross sales"

---

### B. Investment Clarity from Item 7 (30 points max)

Evaluates quality and detail of initial investment breakdown.

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **30 points:** Detailed breakdown with clear assumptions
  - 15+ cost categories itemized
  - Specific ranges with explanation of variables
  - Payment terms and timing specified
  - Assumptions clearly stated
  
- **18 points:** Standard breakdown with basic detail
  - 10-14 cost categories
  - Standard ranges provided
  - Basic context without extensive explanation
  
- **6 points:** Minimal detail
  - <10 categories or very broad categories
  - Wide ranges without explanation
  - Limited context or assumptions

**Rationale:** The SBA and FTC emphasize understanding total investment requirements. Clear investment disclosures help buyers plan adequate capitalization and avoid underfunding.

**Neutral Language Requirements:**
- ❌ "Comprehensive breakdown of costs"
- ✅ "Item 7 lists 17 cost categories with specific ranges"

---

### C. Fee Structure Transparency from Items 5-6 (30 points max)

Evaluates completeness and clarity of fee disclosures.

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **30 points:** All fees clearly disclosed
  - All mandatory and optional fees listed
  - Payment terms and conditions explicit
  - Refundability explicitly stated
  - Calculation methods explained
  
- **18 points:** Standard disclosure
  - All mandatory fees disclosed
  - Conditions stated but not highly detailed
  - Basic payment terms provided
  
- **6 points:** Minimal disclosure
  - Only FTC-required minimum disclosures
  - Vague conditions or terms
  - Unclear refund policies

**Rationale:** Hidden or unclear fees are a major source of franchisee-franchisor disputes. Transparency in fee structure builds trust and enables accurate financial projections.

**Neutral Language Requirements:**
- ❌ "Attractive fee structure"
- ✅ "Item 6 discloses 6% royalty and 2% marketing fee (8% total ongoing fees)"

---

## Dimension 2: System Strength (150 points)

*Predicts long-term viability and franchisor stability*

### A. System Growth Pattern from Item 20 (60 points max)

Evaluates unit growth trends and system stability.

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **60 points:** Healthy growth pattern
  - Net positive growth (openings > closures)
  - Closure rate <5%
  - Consistent 3-year expansion trend
  
- **36 points:** Stable system
  - Flat growth (openings ≈ closures)
  - Moderate closure rate 5-10%
  - Inconsistent growth pattern
  
- **12 points:** Declining system
  - Net negative growth (closures > openings)
  - Closure rate >10%
  - Consistent contraction trend

**Calculation Formulas:**
\`\`\`
Net Growth Rate = ((Units Opened - Units Closed) ÷ Starting Units) × 100
Closure Rate = (Units Closed ÷ Total Units) × 100
\`\`\`

**Rationale:** The FTC and SBA highlight Item 20 as critical. High closure rates may indicate financial struggles, poor support, or flawed business model. Growing systems typically indicate satisfied franchisees and market demand.

**Neutral Language Requirements:**
- ❌ "Impressive system expansion" or "Strong growth"
- ✅ "Item 20 reports net growth of 151 units over 12 months (169% growth rate)"

---

### B. Franchisor Longevity from Item 1 (48 points max)

Evaluates years of franchising experience.

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **48 points:** Established (10+ years franchising)
- **30 points:** Experienced (5-10 years franchising)
- **18 points:** Developing (2-5 years franchising)
- **6 points:** New (<2 years franchising)

**Note:** Score based on years **franchising**, not years in business. A company operating 20 years but franchising for 1 year scores as "New."

**Rationale:** Track record matters. Established franchisors have proven systems, refined operations manuals, and survived business cycles. New franchisors carry higher risk despite potential advantages of innovation.

**Neutral Language Requirements:**
- ❌ "Well-established franchisor"
- ✅ "Item 1 states the franchisor began franchising in 2010 (14 years)"

---

### C. Clean Record from Items 3-4 (42 points max)

Evaluates litigation and bankruptcy history.

**CRITICAL GUIDANCE:**
If Items 3-4 state "no litigation" or "no bankruptcy," this is a **POSITIVE clean record** and should receive maximum points. Never suggest absence of disclosure is "unusual" or implies potential hidden issues. The FTC requires disclosure under 16 CFR Part 436, so absence = clean record during the 10-year lookback period (15 years in Minnesota).

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **42 points:** No disclosed litigation or bankruptcy (clean record)
- **35-40 points:** 1-2 minor cases (depending on nature, recency, resolution)
- **25-30 points:** 3-5 cases
- **0-20 points:** 6+ cases or serious violations

**Assessment Guidelines:**
1. Absence of disclosure is NOT suspicious - it means clean record
2. Do not speculate about undisclosed issues
3. Focus on what IS disclosed (if anything)
4. Consider severity, recency, and resolution status

**Rationale:** The FTC specifically requires disclosure of litigation and bankruptcy for buyer protection. Clean records indicate good business practices, strong franchisee relations, and regulatory compliance.

**Neutral Language Requirements:**
- ❌ "Unusually clean record for a franchise this size"
- ✅ "Items 3 and 4 disclose no litigation or bankruptcy during the required lookback period"

---

## Dimension 3: Franchisee Support (150 points)

*Ensures franchisee success through training and ongoing assistance*

### A. Training Program Quality from Item 11 (60 points max)

Evaluates initial and ongoing training comprehensiveness.

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **60 points:** Multi-week structured program
  - 2+ weeks initial training
  - Multiple training locations/methods
  - Ongoing training programs described
  - Experienced trainers specified
  - Comprehensive topic coverage
  
- **36 points:** Standard training
  - 1-2 weeks initial training
  - Basic ongoing support mentioned
  - Standard topic coverage
  
- **12 points:** Minimal training
  - <1 week or brief training only
  - Limited ongoing support mentioned

**Key Evaluation Factors:**
- Initial training duration and location
- Trainer qualifications and experience
- Ongoing training availability and frequency
- Training materials and methods
- Cost coverage (franchisor vs franchisee paid)

**Rationale:** All industry experts emphasize training as essential for franchisee success. Thorough training reduces failure rates and accelerates profitability.

**Neutral Language Requirements:**
- ❌ "Impressive training program" or "Extensive curriculum"
- ✅ "Item 11 specifies 10-12 week initial training covering operations, marketing, and management"

---

### B. Operational Support from Item 11 (48 points max)

Evaluates ongoing operational assistance provided.

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **48 points:** Multiple support mechanisms
  - Field representative visits (frequency specified)
  - Dedicated support hotline or contact
  - Regular communications/newsletters
  - Technology systems/POS provided
  - Operations manual provided and updated
  
- **30 points:** Standard support
  - Hotline availability
  - Periodic field visits mentioned
  - Basic systems/manual provided
  
- **12 points:** Limited support
  - Minimal ongoing assistance described
  - No field support mentioned

**Key Evaluation Factors:**
- Field representative ratio and visit frequency
- Support hotline/helpdesk availability (hours/days)
- Technology/POS systems included
- Operations manual detail level and update frequency
- Marketing support and materials

**Rationale:** Ongoing support directly correlates with franchisee satisfaction and success. Strong support systems help franchisees overcome operational challenges.

**Neutral Language Requirements:**
- ❌ "Robust support system" or "Comprehensive assistance"
- ✅ "Item 11 specifies quarterly field visits and 24/7 hotline access"

---

### C. Territory Protection from Item 12 (42 points max)

Evaluates territorial rights and exclusivity.

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **42 points:** Protected exclusive territory
  - Clear geographic boundaries defined
  - Exclusivity stated explicitly
  - No online competition from franchisor in territory
  - Restrictions on other franchisees in territory
  
- **24 points:** Limited protection
  - Protected territory defined
  - Exceptions for e-commerce/online sales
  - Other channels (mail order, special events) exempt
  
- **6 points:** No protection
  - No territorial restrictions disclosed
  - Franchisor can compete freely
  - Other franchisees can compete in territory

**Key Evaluation Factors:**
- Geographic territory definition (radius, population, ZIP codes)
- Exclusivity provisions and exceptions
- E-commerce and online sales restrictions
- Franchisor's reserved rights in territory
- Competition from other franchisees allowed

**Rationale:** Territory protections affect competition levels and revenue potential. Clear protections give franchisees better control over market development and customer base.

**Neutral Language Requirements:**
- ❌ "Strong territorial protections"
- ✅ "Item 12 defines protected territory with 50,000 population minimum, excluding franchisor e-commerce sales"

---

## Dimension 4: Business Foundation (150 points)

*Evaluates core business strength and success indicators*

### A. Management Experience from Item 2 (48 points max)

Evaluates management team qualifications and experience.

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **48 points:** Highly experienced team
  - Multiple executives with 10+ years franchise experience
  - Proven track record with other brands
  - Deep industry-specific expertise
  
- **30 points:** Experienced team
  - Some franchise experience across team
  - Relevant operational background
  - Industry knowledge demonstrated
  
- **12 points:** Limited experience
  - Little franchise-specific experience
  - Primarily non-franchise backgrounds
  - Limited tenure with franchisor

**Key Evaluation Factors:**
- Years of franchise industry experience
- Relevant operational/management experience
- Track record with other franchise brands
- Tenure with current franchisor
- Industry-specific expertise and credentials

**Rationale:** The FTC and experts emphasize management team experience as predictor of franchisor performance. Experienced teams better support franchisees and navigate challenges.

**Neutral Language Requirements:**
- ❌ "Impressive management credentials"
- ✅ "Item 2 lists CEO with 15 years franchise experience and VP Operations with 10 years"

---

### B. Item 19 Performance Indicators (72 points max)

Evaluates actual financial performance when disclosed.

**Scoring Rubric (when Item 19 exists):**
- **72 points:** Performance data shows positive indicators
  - Majority of locations meeting/exceeding benchmarks (>50%)
  - Median preferred over average (less skewed)
  - Reasonable distribution (not all top performers)
  - Year-over-year stable or positive trends
  - Profitability indicators included
  - Adequate sample size (>30% of system)
  
- **42 points:** Mixed performance indicators
  - Moderate percentage meeting benchmarks (25-50%)
  - Wide performance variance
  - Limited sample size (<30% of system)
  - Revenue only (no profit data)
  
- **18 points:** Weak performance indicators
  - Low percentage meeting benchmarks (<25%)
  - Declining year-over-year trends
  - Very limited sample
  
- **36 points:** No Item 19 provided
  - Neutral score - absence not inherently negative
  - Some franchisors have valid reasons not to disclose

**Assessment Guidelines:**
- Percentage of locations meeting benchmarks
- Median vs average performance (median preferred)
- Performance distribution (not just top performers)
- Year-over-year trends and consistency
- Profitability indicators (not just revenue)
- Sample size adequacy (% of total system)

**Rationale:** When disclosed, Item 19 performance data is the single best predictor of franchisee success potential. Real financial data beats marketing claims.

**Neutral Language Requirements:**
- ❌ "Strong financial performance" or "Impressive results"
- ✅ "Item 19 reports median gross sales of $345,752 across 87 outlets (43% achieving benchmark)"

---

### C. System Performance from Item 20 (30 points max)

Evaluates operational health through closure rates and growth patterns.

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **30 points:** Positive satisfaction signals
  - Low turnover/transfer rate (<5% annually)
  - Long average tenure (when calculable)
  - High multi-unit ownership rates (>20%)
  - Low reacquisition rate
  
- **18 points:** Neutral signals
  - Average turnover patterns (5-10% annually)
  - Standard tenure indicators
  - Moderate multi-unit rates (10-20%)
  
- **0 points:** Concerning signals
  - High turnover/transfer rate (>10% annually)
  - Many reacquisitions by franchisor
  - Very low multi-unit rates (<10%)

**Key Indicators to Calculate:**
\`\`\`
Transfer Rate = (Total Transfers ÷ Total Units) × 100
Multi-unit Rate = (Multi-unit Owners ÷ Total Franchisees) × 100
Reacquisition Rate = (Units Reacquired ÷ Total Units) × 100
\`\`\`

**Rationale:** Item 20 operational metrics reveal system health. Low closure rates and positive growth indicate a stable, expanding system. These are objective performance indicators rather than subjective satisfaction measures.

**Neutral Language Requirements:**
- ❌ "Exceptional system performance"
- ✅ "Item 20 reports 154 openings and 3 closures in 2024 (closure rate: 3.4%)"

---

## Critical Scoring Guidelines

### 1. NO SUBJECTIVE LANGUAGE

Replace quality judgments with quantitative facts:

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Strong training program" → ✅ "8-week training program"
- ❌ "Impressive growth" → ✅ "Added 151 units over 12 months (169% growth)"
- ❌ "Robust support" → ✅ "Quarterly field visits with 24/7 hotline"
- ❌ "Comprehensive breakdown" → ✅ "Item 7 lists 17 cost categories"
- ❌ "Extensive curriculum" → ✅ "Training covers 12 operational topics"

**Forbidden Words:**
- Quality judgments: significant, impressive, robust, strong, weak, excellent, poor, substantial
- Intensity modifiers: exceptionally, particularly, notably, remarkably, extremely, highly
- Comparative assessments: extensive, limited, adequate, insufficient, comprehensive, thorough
- Value assessments: detailed, minimal, considerable, attractive, concerning, favorable

**Approved Patterns:**
- Quantitative: "X weeks", "Y locations", "Z% of units", "$N investment"
- Descriptive: "includes", "covers", "specifies", "discloses", "states"
- Factual: "Item X provides...", "The document specifies...", "The franchisor discloses..."

---

### 2. LITIGATION/BANKRUPTCY TREATMENT

**Critical Rule:** Absence = Clean Record = Maximum Points

Never suggest absence of disclosure is "unusual" or implies hidden issues. The FTC requires disclosure under 16 CFR Part 436, so no disclosure = clean record.

**Examples:**
- ❌ "The absence of litigation is unusual and may indicate undisclosed issues"
- ✅ "Items 3 and 4 disclose no litigation or bankruptcy during the 10-year lookback period"

---

### 3. CALCULATIONS REQUIRED

Show your work for all scored metrics.

**Standard Formulas:**
\`\`\`
ROI = (Profit ÷ Investment) × 100
Growth Rate = ((New - Old) ÷ Old) × 100
Closure Rate = (Closures ÷ Total Units) × 100
Transfer Rate = (Transfers ÷ Total Units) × 100
\`\`\`

**Example:**
- ❌ "The system shows strong growth"
- ✅ "Net growth: ((154 opened - 3 closed) ÷ 89 starting units) × 100 = 169% growth"

---

### 4. MISSING DATA HANDLING

Explicitly state when calculations are impossible.

**Examples:**
- "Item 19 does not disclose profitability data, ROI cannot be calculated"
- "Insufficient data in Item 20 to determine multi-unit ownership percentage"
- "Item 2 does not specify management tenure, experience assessment limited"

**Scoring When Data Missing:**
- Item 19 Quality: Award 0 points (no disclosure)
- Item 19 Performance: Award 36 points (neutral - absence not negative)
- Other metrics: Award proportional points and explain limitation

---

### 5. CITATIONS REQUIRED

Reference specific Items for all claims.

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Item 7 specifies total investment range of $150K-$300K"
- ✅ "Item 20 reports 450 units as of December 31, 2024"
- ✅ "Item 11 describes 10-12 week initial training program"
- ✅ "Item 6 discloses 6% royalty and 2% marketing fee"

---

## Opportunities & Concerns Generation

### Requirements

Generate **EXACTLY 3 opportunities** and **EXACTLY 3 concerns** for each FDD analysis.

### Structure

Each item must include:
- **title**: Clear, specific (5-10 words)
- **description**: 2-3 sentences with specific data from FDD
- **citation**: Specific Item reference (e.g., "Item 7", "Item 19, Table 1")
- **impact**: "High" | "Medium" | "Low"

### Guidelines

**Opportunities:**
- Highlight genuine strengths disclosed in FDD
- Use specific data points and numbers
- Focus on verifiable advantages
- Avoid marketing language or hype

**Concerns:**
- Note legitimate risks or areas requiring evaluation
- Be balanced - even strong franchises have concerns
- Focus on buyer due diligence needs
- Avoid alarmist language

**Examples:**

**Good Opportunity:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "title": "Detailed Item 19 Financial Performance Data",
  "description": "Item 19 provides financial performance data for 87 outlets, including median gross sales of $345,752. This disclosure enables buyers to make informed projections based on actual system performance rather than estimates.",
  "citation": "Item 19",
  "impact": "High"
}
\`\`\`

**Bad Opportunity (Too Subjective):**
\`\`\`json
{
  "title": "Impressive Financial Transparency",
  "description": "The franchisor demonstrates exceptional commitment to transparency with comprehensive Item 19 disclosure showing strong performance across the system.",
  "citation": "Item 19",
  "impact": "High"
}
\`\`\`

**Good Concern:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "title": "Territory Protection Excludes E-commerce Sales",
  "description": "Item 12 defines protected territories but excludes franchisor e-commerce and 'Blo On The Go' services. Buyers should evaluate potential competition from these channels within their market.",
  "citation": "Item 12",
  "impact": "Medium"
}
\`\`\`

---

## Analytical Summary Requirements

Generate a **4-5 sentence** comprehensive summary that:

1. **Opens with total score and context**
   - State the FranchiseScore (X/600 points)
   - Provide general positioning without comparisons
   
2. **Highlights 2-3 key strengths**
   - Use specific data points from FDD
   - Reference Item numbers
   - Maintain neutral language
   
3. **Notes 1-2 primary concerns**
   - Balanced perspective
   - Specific areas for buyer evaluation
   - No alarmist language
   
4. **Concludes with balanced perspective**
   - Acknowledge both strengths and limitations
   - Frame as buyer decision factors
   - Avoid strong recommendations

### Example Summary

**Good Summary:**
"Blo Blow Dry Bar achieves a FranchiseScore of 438/600 points. The franchise demonstrates financial transparency through Item 19 disclosure covering 87 outlets with median gross sales of $345,752, and shows system stability with 169% net growth in 2024 (154 openings, 3 closures). Item 12 territory protection excludes e-commerce sales, requiring buyers to evaluate potential channel competition. Item 11 specifies a 10-12 week training program with ongoing field support. Buyers should assess market demand for blow dry services and review territory definitions carefully."

**Bad Summary (Too Subjective):**
"Blo Blow Dry Bar scores an impressive 438/600 points, demonstrating a robust franchise opportunity. The exceptionally comprehensive Item 19 and strong growth trajectory indicate a healthy system. While some territorial limitations exist, the extensive training and support programs position franchisees for success. This represents an attractive opportunity in the beauty services sector."

## Critical Pre-Output Reminder

### FINAL ENFORCEMENT - Neutral Language Check

**This section should appear in implementation prompts immediately before JSON generation.**

Before generating your response, review these requirements:

**NEVER use these words in ANY field (explanation, formula_used, etc.):**
❌ comprehensive, extensive, robust, significant, impressive, substantial, strong, weak

**ALWAYS use these patterns instead:**
✅ Numbers: "10-week training program" not "extensive training"
✅ Facts: "Item 7 lists 17 cost categories" not "comprehensive breakdown"
✅ Data: "87 outlets reported" not "substantial sample size"
✅ Descriptions: "The franchisor provides field visits" not "robust support"

**Review your entire JSON output before returning it. Replace any forbidden words with neutral, quantitative descriptions.**
