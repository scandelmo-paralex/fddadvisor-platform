seeks the return of Sentron’s proceeds, unspecified monetary damages, punitive damages, the imposition
of a constructive trust, disgorgement and attorneys’ fees. The breach of fiduciary duty count was
dismissed in December 2020. On March 15, 2021, Ace Hardware filed an Amended Cross-Complaint

Unfair Competition Law by: (i) aiding and abetting Sentron’s fraudulent business practices; and (ii)
violating its internal commercial lending policies and federal banking guidelines and regulations. On
