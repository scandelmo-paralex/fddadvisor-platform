Notes:

$1.00 for each additional household in your Territory over 70,000 households. The high end represents
the Initial Franchise Fee for the maximum territory size of 100,000. There may be a discount available to
you.
If you acquire a Mini AHS Business, the Initial Franchise Fee is between $35,000 and $45,000.
All other expenses remain the same.

(2) The initial training program is tuition-free for up to four people. However, you will pay for the
expenses of attendance, including lodging, meals, transportation, and wages of trainees.
(3) You must operate from a small office outside of your home. A commercial lease normally
requires payment of the first month’s rent, a security deposit and a rent deposit equal to one month’s rent.
A lease deposit may or may not be refundable and lease deposits vary widely from location to location.
You will also incur costs to furnish your office, which may include purchasing a desk, office chair, file
cabinets, decorations, and other office items.
(4) You can rent tools or you may find it cost effective to purchase various tools with a high use rate.
The tools you are required to acquire include ladders of varying lengths, a tub saw for tile, a chop box
with miter saw, a hammer drill, various pneumatic tools with an air compressor, and various hand tools.
The low end of this estimate assumes you already own the necessary tools.
(5) You are not required to purchase or lease a vehicle until you have three fulltime craftsmen
(working an average of 30 hours per week or more). You may purchase or lease a vehicle before you
reach this requirement. Any vehicle you acquire must be either a van or truck and we recommend that it
be white, gray, red, or black.
(6) Includes a computer and software meeting our minimum specifications that you purchase from
suppliers selected by you. You will need a workstation, laser printer, fax software, hub-router, network,
and wiring. A high-speed Internet connection is also required. If you do not already own one, you will
need a smart phone or other device we approve meeting our standards and specifications. The standards
and specifications we are currently utilizing are set forth in the Operations Manual.
(7) In exchange for the Software and Internet Fee, we give you access to our scheduling software, e-
mail, location website, and online marketing services, which includes website development services and
search engine optimization. We also maintain an Internet site for prospective customers and an Intranet
site for you and other franchisees. We reserve the right to discontinue providing the e-mail account and
Intranet sites, if technology advancements make these obsolete or impractical to provide. The amounts
shown in the chart are for the fees for the first three months following the commencement of operations of
your AHS Business. We pay a portion of the Software and Internet Fee to our designated suppliers for
website development services, search engine optimization, and other online marketing services. These
services do not include paid, placed media advertising, which is an additional expense paid to the vendor
directly by you.
(8) You must spend between $8,000 and $12,000 as a required initial marketing expense in the
period starting 30 days before opening, and continuing through the end of the second full month after
opening of your franchise. This amount includes collateral marketing materials that will last for a period
of time beyond the first three months of operation and are purchased in quantities based on price
considerations. You must also spend between $1,000 and $4,000 for a required Grand Opening event.

(9) Licensing laws and permit requirements, including fees, may vary from state to state and from
city to city, depending on state and local laws. You must comply with these laws. This estimate also
includes the costs associated with obtaining the required LRRP Certification for your AHS Business and
one individual representative, including the estimated costs for the required training course provided by
the EPA or a third party.
(10) You must procure, maintain and provide evidence of (i) workers’ compensation insurance with
employers liability coverage, with a broad form all-states endorsement coverage sufficient to meet the
requirements of law (or, if such coverage is not required by applicable law, then with limits of at least $1
million and otherwise meeting the requirements we designate); (ii) comprehensive general liability
insurance including product liability, property damage, personal injury liability, bodily injury coverage,
and premises/operation liability for the Business Location and its operations, with a limit of not less than
$1 million per occurrence and $2 million in the aggregate, or such greater limit as may be required as part
of any lease agreement for the Business Location; with a crime policy endorsement with a limit of not less
than $25,000; (iii) comprehensive automobile liability insurance including hired and non-owned coverage
with a limit of not less than $1 million per occurrence and $2 million in the aggregate; (iv) umbrella
commercial excess coverage with a limit of not less than $1 million; and (v) all-risk business property
insurance covering all equipment, tenant improvements, inventory and other personal property owned or
leased by you in an amount equal to at least 100 percent of the replacement costs of the contents and
tenant improvements located at the Business Location, less a reasonable deductible which cannot exceed
$5,000. Cyber liability insurance in an amount of not less than $250,000 is optional but highly
recommended. We reserve the right to require that you obtain and maintain, in addition to all other
policies of insurance, employment practices insurance in such amount as we specify. All of the required
policies of insurance must name us as an additional insured with waiver of subrogation and must provide
for a 10 day advance written notice to us of cancellation. Prior to opening your AHS Business, and
within 15 days after each successor franchise term begins, you must provide a certificate of insurance as
to the insurance coverage maintained to a third-party administrator we use to monitor insurance
compliance.
(11) The disclosure laws require us to include this estimate of all expenses to operate your AHS
Business during the “initial period” of the business, which is defined as three months or a longer period if
“reasonable for the industry.” We are not aware of any established longer “reasonable period,” so our
disclosures cover an estimate of start-up expenses for an initial three-month period. These expenses do
not include your living expenses or expenses if you decide to employ assistants. You are required to
appoint an office manager (“Office Manager”) who will answer the phone, schedule your craftsmen, and
assist with running your office for your AHS Business within 75 days of signing your Franchise
Agreement. We have included an estimate for the costs you will incur during the first three months to
employ the required Office Manager. Based on records we received from our franchisees, we estimate
that you will pay the Office Manager an hourly rate of $24 to $30 per hour, for 40 hours per week, for
each of the first 12 weeks of operation of your AHS Business.
(12) The estimated initial investment set forth in this table assumes that you will acquire the franchise
rights for one AHS Business with a Territory of up to 100,000 households. If you acquire more than one
AHS Business, your estimated initial investment will increase.
(13) The chart contains estimates only and we cannot guarantee that you will not have additional
expenses starting your business. Your actual expenses may exceed our estimates. The information in the
chart is not intended to imply that your AHS Business will reach the breakeven point or any other
financial goal by that time. We recommend that you have (or have access to) additional startup capital
beyond the amounts shown in the table above.

(14) We relied on over 75 years of combined experience of certain officers of the company in the
handyman service business to compile these estimates. You should review these figures carefully with a
business advisor before making any decision to purchase the franchise.
(15) No payments to us are refundable. Payments to third parties may or may not be refundable
depending on your agreement with such third parties; however, usually such payments are nonrefundable.
