In the event we require you to use the mark ACE\nHARDWARE HANDYMAN SERVICES, you will be required to adopt and use that mark.\nAn AHS Business provides handyman, and repair and maintenance services, and sales to residential and\ncommercial customers by operating under a uniform system consisting of high standards of service, use of\nquality products, proprietary and exclusive technology, and the business format created and developed by\nus and our predecessors (the \u201cAce Handyman Services System\u201d). These handyman services include basic\nservices in the categories of carpentry, plumbing and electrical, drywall, painting, flooring, landscaping\nand many other miscellaneous repairs, and services to residential and commercial clients. The services\nprovided by an AHS Business do not include advanced services in the categories of plumbing and\nelectrical, painting, heating, cooling, air conditioning, and other categories. Those more advanced\nservices are better suited for professionals that specialize in these services.\nWhen you obtain a franchise from us, we license to you the right to use our Marks and the Ace Handyman\nServices System within a protected territory that will be assigned to you (\u201cTerritory\u201d).

We call this franchise our \u201cMini AHS Business.\u201d Mini AHS Business\nfranchises are only granted by us when the Territory has 45,000 or fewer households. All references in\nthis Disclosure Document to an AHS Business include our Mini AHS Business unless we specifically\nnote otherwise.\nYou will operate from a small office outside of your home (\u201cBusiness Location\u201d).

There are also federal, state, and in some cases, local laws and\nregulations pertaining specifically to the building and construction industry and your franchise, which\nvary and can change over time. These include laws and regulations pertaining to lead paint removal and\ndisposal, asbestos handling and removal, and hazardous waste handling and disposal. You will need to\nbecome knowledgeable of, and comply with, all applicable local, state, and national uniform building\ncodes, including plumbing, structural and electric codes, and licensing regulations and requirements. The\nNational Association of Remodeling Industry publishes a \u201cSummary of State Contractor Licensing\nLaws,\u201d which we strongly suggest you review.\nAmong the federal regulations that are applicable to your franchise are regulations promulgated by the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d). On April 22, 2010, the EPA\u2019s Renovation, Repair and\nMaintenance Final Rule (\u201cRRP\u201d) went into effect. This RRP details both information that must be given\nto certain homeowners as well as processes and procedures that must be followed in homes and other\nstructures built before 1978. See https://www.epa.gov/lead/lead-renovation-repair-and-painting-program.\nYou will also need to comply with the \u201cLead Renovation, Repair, and Painting\u201d rule (the \u201cLRRP Rule\u201d)\nof the EPA. The LRRP Rule generally applies to any renovation, repair, and painting activities that may\ndisturb paint in homes and certain other facilities constructed prior to 1978, on the basis that lead paint\nmay be present in those facilities. Your AHS Business will likely be involved in these activities. To\ncomply with the LRRP Rule, both your AHS Business and the individual representative or representatives\nof your AHS Business carrying out these activities must be certified by the EPA (the \u201cLRRP\nCertification\u201d). To obtain an LRRP Certification, the applicable representative or representatives must\ncomplete an initial training course provided or accredited by the EPA. We do not provide this training\ncourse. You must obtain the LRRP Certification for your AHS Business and at least one individual\nrepresentative prior to participating in our initial training program. Recertification and refresher training\ncourses are required under the LRRP Rule every five years to maintain the LRRP Certification. You must\nmaintain the LRRP Certification for your AHS Business and at least one individual representative at all\ntimes. You must provide us with evidence of the LRRP Certification. The LRRP Rule additionally\nimposes certain requirements related to how the relevant renovation, repair, and painting activities are\ncarried out, which include the distribution of a mandatory informational pamphlet to the customer, paint\ntesting, cleaning verification, waste disposal, recordkeeping, and other requirements. There may be other\nEPA regulations that will apply to your AHS Business.\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) has issued regulations pertaining to\nworker safety and health in the workplace. OSHA has also issued regulations pertaining to exposure to\nairborne concentrations of lead above certain levels. Many states and municipalities also have laws\nregulating the handling and disposal of hazardous materials, including paint and solvents, as well as laws\nand regulations pertaining to worker safety and health in the workplace.\nThere are federal, state and possibly local laws covering how to classify workers, for example, whether as\nindependent contractors or employees, or as exempt or non-exempt, for different purposes, such as tax,\nwage and hour laws, unemployment compensation and workers\u2019 compensation. These laws and\nregulations can vary from state to state, city to city and at the federal level, and could affect, in some\ninstances materially, the operation of your AHS Business.\nIn addition to the laws referenced above, you will be required to comply with all federal, state and local\nlaws, rules and ordinances that apply generally to all businesses, including, but not limited to, taxes, data\nprotection and privacy laws.

Counsel for the putative class subsequently filed numerous motions for leave to file\nseveral amended complaints which named new and additional putative class representatives, and Ace\nHardware filed motions to dismiss and oppositions to the various motions to compel. Finally, the then\nnamed plaintiffs (fifteen corporate entities and seven bankruptcy trustees) and Ace Hardware attended a\nmediation on July 26, 2016. The plaintiffs\u2019 sought $2.5 million for a global settlement. Ace Hardware\nmade an offer to settle with the plaintiffs for $25,000 each, which was subsequently accepted by all of the\nplaintiffs. The case was subsequently dismissed with prejudice on July 27, 2017.\nAce Handyman Services, Inc. v. Ace Hardware Corporation et al.

These expenses do\nnot include your living expenses or expenses if you decide to employ assistants. You are required to\nappoint an office manager (\u201cOffice Manager\u201d) who will answer the phone, schedule your craftsmen, and\nassist with running your office for your AHS Business within 75 days of signing your Franchise\nAgreement. We have included an estimate for the costs you will incur during the first three months to\nemploy the required Office Manager. Based on records we received from our franchisees, we estimate\nthat you will pay the Office Manager an hourly rate of $24 to $30 per hour, for 40 hours per week, for\neach of the first 12 weeks of operation of your AHS Business.\n(12) The estimated initial investment set forth in this table assumes that you will acquire the franchise\nrights for one AHS Business with a Territory of up to 100,000 households. If you acquire more than one\nAHS Business, your estimated initial investment will increase.\n(13) The chart contains estimates only and we cannot guarantee that you will not have additional\nexpenses starting your business. Your actual expenses may exceed our estimates. The information in the\nchart is not intended to imply that your AHS Business will reach the breakeven point or any other\nfinancial goal by that time. We recommend that you have (or have access to) additional startup capital\nbeyond the amounts shown in the table above.\n4934-4627-3032 (Ace Handyman - 1)",

Governing Law/Consent to Jurisdiction/Waiver of Jury Trial.\nThe United States Federal Arbitration Act shall govern all questions about the\nenforceability of the dispute resolution procedures in this Agreement and the confirmation of any\narbitration awards pursuant to such procedures, and no arbitration issues are to be resolved\npursuant to any state or provincial statutes, regulations or common law.

Our responsibilities under those\nstandards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be\nindependent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We\nbelieve that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\nResponsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of\nfinancial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise\nsubstantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued.\nAuditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud\nor error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore\nis not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a\nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,\nmisrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the\naggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.\nIn performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we:\n\u2022 Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.\n\u2022 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit\nprocedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nfinancial statements.\n\u2022 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circwnstances, but\nnot for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.\n\u2022 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well\nas evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\u2022 Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's\nability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.\nWe are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant\naudit findings, and certain internal control related matters that we identified during the audit.\nOther Information\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and\nresults of operations and five year summary of earnings and distributions but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our\nopinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information, and we do not express an opinion or any form of assurance thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and consider whether a material inconsistency\nexists between the other information and the financial statements, or the other information otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work\nperformed, we conclude that an unrecorded material misstatement of the other information exists, we are required to describe it in our report.\n~+n-LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 11, 2025\n4934-4627-3032 (Ace Handyman - 1)",

The Company also\nprovides to its retail members (\"Retailers\") value-added services such as advertising, marketing, merchandising and store location and\ndesign services. The Company's goods and services are sold predominately within the United States, primarily to retailers that operate\nhardware stores and with whom the Company has a retail membership agreement. As a retailer-owned cooperative, the Company\ndistributes substantially all of its patronage sourced income in the form of patronage distributions to Retailers based on their volume of\nmerchandise purchases.\nAce Hardware International Holdings, Ltd. (\"AIH''), is a majority-owned and controlled subsidiary of the Company with a 21.1\npercent noncontrolling interest held by AIH customers. AIH shareholders do not own shares of stock in the Company nor receive\npatronage dividends.\nAce Retail Holdings LLC (\"ARH\") is the owner of the 180-store Westlake Ace Hardware (\"Westlake\") and the 79-store Great\nLakes Ace Hardware (\"GLA\") retail chains. As a result, the Company is also a retailer of hardware, paint and other related products.\nAce Wholesale Holdings LLC (\"AWH\") owns and operates Emery Jensen Distribution (\"EID\"). EID is a wholesaler of\nhardware, paint and other related products to non-member retailers.\nAce Services Holdings LLC (\"ASH\"), through its subsidiaries, operates Ace Hardware Home Services (\"AHHS\"), a provider\nof residential plumbing, heating, cooling and electric (\"PHCE\") services, and Ace Handyman Services, a franchisor of home\nimprovement, maintenance and repair services.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (\"GAAP\"). The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest December 30. Accordingly, fiscal years\n2024, 2023 and 2022 ended on December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Unless otherwise noted,\nall references herein for the years 2024, 2023 and 2022 represent fiscal years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively. Fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 consisted of 52 weeks.\nSubsequent events have been evaluated through February 11, 2025, the date these statements were issued.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries.\nAll intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and\nexpenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nIn the normal course of business, the Company has outstanding checks that exceed the cash balances in the Company's bank\naccounts, which create a book overdraft that are recorded as a liability. As of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the Company\nhad outstanding checks in excess of bank balances totaling $93.6 million and $78.4 million, respectively, which have been included in\naccounts payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These outstanding amounts were subsequently funded through cash\nreceipts and borrowings under the Company's debt facilities during the following fiscal year.\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less as cash equivalents.\n4934-4627-3032 (Ace Handyman - 1)",

(\"NAIL\") subsidiary, at the time of purchase and evaluates such designation at each\nbalance sheet date. All marketable securities have been classified and accounted for as available for sale. The Company may hold debt\nsecurities until maturity. In response to changes in the availability of and the yield on alternative investments as well as liquidity\nrequirements, securities are occasionally sold prior to their stated maturities. Debt securities with maturities beyond twelve months are\nviewed by the Company as available to support current operations and are therefore classified as current assets in the accompanying\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Marketable securities are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices, with unrealized gains and\nlosses, net of taxes, reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") for debt securities, while equity\nsecurities' unrealized gain and losses are recorded as a component of Other income, net. Realized gains and losses on securities are\ndetennined using the specific identification method.\nIn the normal course ofNAIL's operations, standby letters of credit totaling $17.2 million and $33.3 million at December 28,\n2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, were issued in favor of the insurance companies that reinsure a portion of NAIL's loss\nexposure. At December 28, 2024, NAIL has pledged substantially all of its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as\ncollateral for these letters of credit. The Company maintains a multiple employer welfare arrangement (\"MEW A\") that offers medical\ninsurance and other welfare benefits to employees of the Company and Retailers and their employees at participating Ace retail locations.\nAce has provided a $15 .0 million standby letter of credit to the State of Vennont in connection with the MEW A. See Note 12 for more\ninfonnation.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of contracts with our customers are satisfied; generally,\nthis occurs with the transfer of control of merchandise or services. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to\nreceive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. The Company excludes sales and usage-based taxes collected and\nrecognizes revenues net of expected returns. Provisions for sales returns are provided at the time the related sales are recorded based\non historic returns activity.\nThe Company's warehouse merchandise revenue originates with a single perfonnance obligation to ship the products, and\ntherefore the Company's perfonnance obligations are satisfied when control of the products is transferred to the customer per the\narranged shipping terms. The customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss for warehouse merchandise upon delivery. Although\nproducts are generally shipped FOB shipping point, the Company effectively retains the responsibilities of ownership until the goods\nreach the customer. The Company considers shipping and handling as activities to fulfill its perfonnance obligation for warehouse\nmerchandise revenues. Billings for freight are accounted for as Revenues and shipping and handling costs are accounted for in Cost of\nrevenues.\nThe Company has direct shipment arrangements with various vendors to deliver products to its customers without having to\nphysically hold the inventory at the Company's warehouses, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs. The Company recognizes\nrevenue for direct shipment arrangements upon delivery to the customer with contract terms that typically specify FOB destination. The\nCompany recognizes the revenue and cost of goods sold from these arrangements on a gross basis as the principal in the transaction as\nthe Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to customers to provide merchandise at negotiated prices with the\nvendors, assumes inventory risk if the product is returned by the customers, and assumes all the credit risk for the vendors with the\ncustomers.\nService revenues (advertising activities, brand building initiatives and fees for other services provided primarily to domestic\nRetailers) are recognized when the service is complete as this is when the Retailer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the\nbenefits from the service. Service revenues from the Company's residential home service businesses are recognized when the repair or\ninstallation is complete and the consumer has tendered payment. Service revenues are included in Wholesale revenues on the\nConsolidated Statements of Income.\nThe Company's e-commerce revenues come from Ace Hardware's website. For e-commerce transactions, customers choose\nwhether to have merchandise delivered to them or to collect their merchandise from an Ace store (\"in-store pick up\"). For items\ndelivered directly to the customer, control passes and revenue is recognized when delivery has been completed to the customer, as title\nhas passed and we have transferred possession to the customer. For in-store pick up, control passes and revenue is recognized once the\ncustomer has taken possession of the merchandise. Any fees charged to customers for delivery are a component of the transaction price\nand are recognized when delivery has been completed. Payment tenns for retail and e-commerce sales are at the point of sale. E\ncommerce revenues are included in Wholesale revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nRetail revenues from retail locations owned and operated by the Company and e-commerce revenues are recognized when the\ncustomer takes ownership of the products sold and assumes the risk of loss. The customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss\ngenerally at the point of sale in our owned retail locations. The Company offers its Retailers various incentive programs which provide\nthe Retailers with certain sales allowances. The Company offers these incentive programs in anticipation of future sales to the Retailers\n4934-4627-3032 (Ace Handyman - 1)",

The Company offers its Retailers various incentive programs which provide\nthe Retailers with certain sales allowances. The Company offers these incentive programs in anticipation of future sales to the Retailers\n4934-4627-3032 (Ace Handyman - 1)\n\n\n\nACE HARDWARE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\n(In millions)\nthat participate in these programs. Since the sales allowances provide future economic benefit to the Company, they are capitalized in\nOther assets and amortized as a reduction of revenue on a straight-line basis over the period of expected future sales to these Retailers,\nwhich is generally five years.\nThe following table provides a summary of revenues by sales category:\nYears Ended\nDecember 28, December 30,\n2024 2023\nWarehouse merchandise ~-~--~~---~-----~---\"$'- 6,162.7 $ 6,060.7\nDirect shipment merchandise 1,556.9 1,491.0\nARH revenues 825.4 786.4\nE-commerce 382.3 334.0\nService revenues 564.1 459.0\nTotal revenues $ 9,491.4 $ 9,131.1\nTrade Receivables\nTrade receivables from customers include amounts invoiced for the sale of merchandise, services and equipment used in the\noperation of customers' businesses.\nNotes Receivable\nThe Company makes available to its Retailers various lending programs whose terms exceed one year. The notes bear interest\nat various rates based on market rates, the loan program or the Retailer's credit quality and are recorded at face value. Interest is\nrecognized over the life of the note on the effective interest method. Loan origination fees were not material for any period presented.\nAllowance for Expected Credit Losses\nThe Company estimates an allowance for credit losses related to future expected losses by using relevant information such as\nhistorical collection statistics, current customer credit information, the current economic environment, the aging of receivables, the\nevaluation of compliance with lending covenants and the offsetting amounts due to Retailers for stock, notes, interest and anticipated\nbut unpaid patronage distributions. Significant past due accounts are reserved on a specific identification basis. For the remainder of\nthe accounts, the allowance is evaluated on a pool basis for accounts with similar risk characteristics and a loss-rate for each pool is\ndetermined using current conditions and historical credit loss statistics. The Company considers accounts and notes receivable past due\nif invoices remain unpaid past their due date and provides for the write-off of uncollectible receivables after exhausting all commercially\nreasonable collection efforts.\nInventories\nWholesale inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined primarily using the last-in,\nfirst-out (\"LIFO\") method for all inventories.\nInventories at retail locations operated by ARH are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventory cost is\ndetermined using the moving average method, which approximates the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method.\nVendor Funds\nThe Company receives funds from vendors in the normal course of business principally as a result of purchase volumes, sales,\nearly payments or promotions of vendors' products. Based on the provisions of the vendor agreements in place, management develops\naccrual rates by estimating the point at which the Company will have completed its performance under the agreement and the amount\nagreed upon will be earned. Amounts accrued throughout the year can be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected\nannual purchase volumes. At year-end, the accrual reflects actual purchases made throughout the year.\nVendor funds are treated as a reduction of inventory cost, unless they represent a reimbursement of specific, incremental and\nidentifiable costs incurred by the Company to sell the vendor's product, in which case the costs are netted. The majority of the vendor\nfunds that the Company receives do not meet the specific, incremental and identifiable criteria. Therefore, the Company treats a majority\nof these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory as the amounts are accrued and recognizes these funds as a reduction of cost of\nrevenues when the inventory is sold.\n4934-4627-3032 (Ace Handyman - 1)",

Expenditures for maintenance,\nrepairs and renewals of relatively minor items are generally charged to expense. Significant improvements or renewals are capitalized.\nDepreciation expense is computed on the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives as follows:\nIS - -40 years\nLeasehold improvements Lease li-fe --\nWarehouse c;gl!iP.ment 3- 20 years\nTransportation equipment 5 - 10 years\nOffice tl4l!iP.ment J - JOyears\nLeasehold improvements are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful\nlife of the asset.\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is\nmeasured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated\nby the asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized\nin the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired and\nidentified intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level on an annual basis as of the\nfirst day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently, if circumstances change or an event occurs that would more likely than not reduce\nthe fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.\nThe Company's other intangible assets primarily relate to trademarks, tradenames and customer relationships. The intangibles\nare amortized over their estimated useful lives.\nSee Note 8 for additional information.\nInternal-Use Software\nIncluded in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internal-use software. The Company capitalizes costs incurred during the\napplication development stage of internal-use software and amortizes these costs over its estimated useful life. Costs incurred related\nto design or maintenance of internal-use software are expensed as incurred.\nLeases\nAt the commencement date of a lease, the Company recognizes a liability to make lease payments and an asset representing\nthe right to use the underlying asset during the lease term. The lease liability is measured at the present value of lease payments over\nthe lease term, including variable fees that are known or subject to a minimum floor. The Company generally does not include options\nto extend or terminate leases unless it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. The Company has lease agreements that\ncontain both lease and non-lease components. The Company elected to not separate non-lease components from lease components for\nall categories. The Company utilizes the practical expedient to use a risk-free discount rate at commencement date based upon the lease\nterm in determining the recognition of the operating and finance lease assets and liabilities. The initial valuation of the right-of-use\n(\"ROU\") asset includes the initial measurement of the lease liability, lease payments made in advance of the lease commencement date\nand initial direct costs incurred by the Company and excludes lease incentives.\nReal estate operating leases also typically require payment ofreal estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These\ncomponents comprise the majority of variable lease costs and are excluded from the present value of lease obligations. Operating lease\nassets also include prepaid or accrued lease payments and are reduced by lease incentives.\nCertain retail lease agreements also provide for contingent rentals based on sales performance in excess of specified minimums\nor on changes in the consumer price indexes. Contingent rentals, which are based upon future performance or changes in indices, are\nexcluded from the determination of lease payments and were not material.\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are classified as short-term leases and are not recorded on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. The lease expense for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n4934-4627-3032 (Ace Handyman - 1)",

Gross advertising expenses amounted to $336.9 million, $297.7\nmillion, and $263.6 million in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nGift Cards\nThe Company sells gift cards to customers through its Retailers, the Company website and select third parties. The gift cards\ndo not expire. A liability is initially established for the value of the gift card when sold. Gift card breakage income is recognized\nproportionately as redemption occurs at the approximate monthly breakage rate and represents the balance of gift cards for which the\nCompany believes the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote. The breakage income calculation takes into account any\nlegal obligation to remit the unredeemed portion to relevant jurisdictions. During fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company\nrecognized gift card breakage income of$4.3 million, $3.3 million and $3.3 million, respectively. The Company does not believe there\nis a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that we use to record breakage.\nRetirement Plans\nThe Company sponsors health benefit plans for its retired officers and a limited number ofretired non-officer employees. The\nCompany and its subsidiaries also sponsor defined contribution plans for substantially all employees. The Company's contributions\nunder these plans are determined annually by the Board of Directors and charged to expense in the period in which it is earned by\nemployees.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this approach, deferred taxes are\nrecognized for the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of existing assets and\nliabilities and measured based upon enacted tax laws and rates.\nSelf-Insurance\nNAIL, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, operates as a captive insurance company. NAIL provides the reinsurance of\nproperty and casualty insurance policies for some Retailers and is the direct insurer for certain property and casualty insurance policies\nof the Company. These insurance programs are subject to varying retention levels of self-insurance. Such self-insurance relates to\nlosses and liabilities primarily associated with property, general liability, workers' compensation, and auto liability insurance programs.\nLosses are accrued based upon the Company's estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions\nbased on Company experience and insurance industry metrics.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nCredit risk pertains primarily to the Company's trade and notes receivables. The Company extends credit to its customers as\npart of its day-to-day operations. Management believes that as no specific receivable or group of receivables comprises a significant\npercentage of total trade accounts, its concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited. Additionally, management\nbelieves that its allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate with respect to overall customer credit risks. Also, the Company's\ncertificate of incorporation and by-laws specifically provide that the Company may set-off its obligation to make any payment to a\nRetailer for such Retailer's stock, notes, interest and declared and unpaid distributions against any obligation owed by the Retailer to\nthe Company. The Company, but not the Retailer, may at its sole discretion exercise these set-off rights when any such funds become\ndue to former Retailers with outstanding accounts and notes receivable owed to the Company and current Retailers with past due\nreceivables owed to the Company.\nImpact of New Accounting Standards\nThere are no recently issued applicable accounting pronouncements that are not yet effective that are expected to have a material\nimpact on consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial condition, or consolidated cash flows.\n4934-4627-3032 (Ace Handyman - 1)",

These acquisitions resulted in UIC recording $34.1 million of goodwill. The Company believes these acquisitions will\nhelp advance the Company's strategic plan to be a leading provider of home preservation services.

In the event a Retailer cancels its\nmembership with the Company, any outstanding loans are transferred from Notes receivable to Trade receivables and are due\nimmediately. As the non-cash portion of the patronage distribution is used to settle the Notes receivable, there are no loans that are\ncurrently past due. The patronage distribution for each Retailer can vary from year to year based on the Company's financial\nperformance, as well as the volume of patronage-based merchandise that each Retailer purchases from the Company. The contractual\nmaturities, assuming no patronage deductions, of the Notes receivable are as follows:\nDecember 28, December 30,\n2024 2023\n0-4 years $ 25.5 $ 14.2\n5 - 8 years 27.1 31.8\n9-10 years 22.0 20.4\nTotal $ 74.6 $ 66.4\nThe Company evaluates risk on its loan portfolio by categorizing each loan into an internal risk category. The Company's risk\ncategories include:\nLow - The Retailer possesses a strong financial position, above average payment record to both Ace and other vendors, and\nthe business is well established.\nModerate - The Retailer possesses an average financial position, an average payment record to both Ace and other vendors,\nand the business is somewhat established.\nHigh - The Retailer possesses a weak financial position, a substandard payment record to Ace or other vendors, or the business\nis somewhat new.\nBased upon these criteria, the Company has classified its loan portfolio as follows:\nDecember 28, December 30,\nCorporate Credit Exposure: 2024 2023\nLow risk $ 29.1 $ 26.8\nModerate risk 27.1 22.1\nHigh risk 18.4 17.5\nTotal $ 74.6 $ 66.4\nPursuant to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Company's by-laws, notes receivable\n(like all obligations owed to the Company by the Company's Retailers) are secured by the Company stock owned by the Retailers. For\nthis reason, as well as the fact that substantially all of the notes receivable are repaid from the following year's annual patronage\ndistribution, the actual risk of collection is low for the notes receivable portfolio despite many Retailers being classified as Moderate\nand High risk.\n4934-4627-3032 (Ace Handyman - 1)",

For\nthis reason, as well as the fact that substantially all of the notes receivable are repaid from the following year's annual patronage\ndistribution, the actual risk of collection is low for the notes receivable portfolio despite many Retailers being classified as Moderate\nand High risk.\n4934-4627-3032 (Ace Handyman - 1)\n\n\n\nACE HARDWARE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\n(In millions)\nThe Company applies a consistent practice of establishing an allowance for notes that it feels may become uncollectible by\nmonitoring the financial strength of its Retailers. The collectability of certain notes is evaluated on an individual basis, while the\nremaining notes are evaluated on a collective basis. Due to the nature of the notes and the collateral held by the Company, virtually all\noutstanding notes were collectively evaluated for impairment.\nThe Company has evaluated the collectability of the notes and has established an allowance for doubtful accounts of $2.0\nmillion and $1.6 million for December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively. The allowance for 2024 was reclassified to\nReceivables, net as substantially all notes are classified as short-term. Management records the allowance for doubtful accounts based\non the above information as well as judgments made considering a number of factors, primarily historical collection statistics, current\nRetailer credit information, the current economic environment and the offsetting amounts due to Retailers for stock, notes, interest and\ndeclared and unpaid patronage distributions. The components of changes to the Notes receivable allowance for doubtful accounts for\n2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nDecember 28, December 30,\n2024 2023\nBeginning balance $ 1.6 $\nCharges to provision 0.4 0.6\nReclassifications (to) from accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts (2.0) 1.0\nEnding balance $ $ 1.6\nNotes bear interest at various rates and are recorded at face value. Interest is recognized over the life of the note based on the\noutstanding balance and stated interest rate, which approximates the effective interest method. During fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022,\n$5.9 million, $4.6 million and $2.2 million respectively, were recorded as interest income related to the notes.\nGenerally, in the event a Retailer cancels their membership with the Company, any outstanding Notes receivable, and related\nallowance for doubtful accounts, are transferred to trade receivables and the Retailer is billed for any unpaid principal and interest\nbalances. In fiscal 2024 and 2023, $14.5 million and $8.5 million, respectively, ofNotes receivable were transferred to Trade receivables\nas an event occurred which made the notes due immediately.\n(8) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nChanges in the carrying value of goodwill were as follows:\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ 101.5\nAcquired goodwill 271.8\nBalance at December 30, 2023 373.3\nPurchase accounting adjustments 3.4\nAcquired goodwill (See Note 2 for additional details) 46.3\nBalance at December 28, 2024 $ 423.0\nImpairment exists when a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value.

The Company's valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of Level 1 investments\nare derived from quoted market prices for identical instruments, as active markets for these instruments exist. The Company has\nclassified its investments used to support the Company's deferred compensation plan as Other assets as these investments are restricted\nsolely for this purpose.\nlevel 2 - Investments included in this category are the Company's Corporate fixed income securities, Mortgage-backed\nsecurities and Other debt securities. Other debt securities primarily consist of taxable municipal bonds, corporate asset-backed securities,\nand U.S. Agency fixed rate notes and bonds. The Company's valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of Level 2 securities\nare derived from the following: non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data, quoted market\nprices for similar instruments, or pricing models, such as discounted cash flow techniques, with all significant inputs derived from or\ncorroborated by observable market data.\nlevel 3 - Uses inputs that are unobservable and are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant\nmanagement judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management's\nestimates of market participant assumptions.\nThe tables below set forth, by level, the Company's financial assets that were accounted for at fair value as of December 28,\n2024 and December 30, 2023.

Fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 contain 52 weeks of operating results. Unless\notherwise noted, all references herein for the years 2024, 2023 and 2022 represent fiscal years ended December 28, 2024, December 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial\nstatements and the related notes included in this annual report that have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (\"GAAP\").\nCompany Overview\nThe Company is a wholesaler of hardware and other related products and provides services and best practices for its member\nRetailers (\"Retailers\"). The overall home improvement industry is estimated to be approximately $526 billion and consists of a broad\nrange of products and services, including lawn and garden products, paint and sundries, certain building supplies and general\nmerchandise typically used in connection with home and property improvement, remodeling, repair and maintenance. The industry is\nfragmented and competition exists between the large home improvement centers, retail hardware stores and other chains offering\nhardware merchandise. In addition, we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers.\nThe Company's Retailers generally compete in the $65 billion \"convenience hardware\" segment which is characterized by\npurchases primarily of products related to home maintenance and repair, including paint and related products, lawn and garden\nequipment, and those products less focused on large-scale building, renovation and remodeling projects. The Company believes that\nthe following competitive strengths distinguish it from its peers and contribute to its success in the convenience hardware market: (1)\nstrong consumer recognition of the Ace Brand; (2) well-regarded for exceptional customer service and convenience; (3) strength of\ndistribution operations; ( 4) consolidated purchasing power; (5) differentiated and localized product and service offerings; and (6) a\ndiversified network of independent retailers.\nThe Company strives to be the best provider of products, services and operating methods for convenience hardware retailers.\nThe four main drivers that support that goal and the Company's efforts to grow the business are improving the store model, accelerating\nnew store openings, increasing store projects that drive store sales and profitability and reducing the number of store closings.\nAce Hardware International Holdings, Ltd. (\"AIH\"), is a majority-owned and controlled subsidiary of the Company with a 21. l\npercent noncontrolling interest held by AIH customers. AIH shareholders do not own shares of stock in the Company nor receive\npatronage dividends. AIH has wholesale distribution capabilities in Ningbo, China and Cuautitlan lzcalli, Mexico. AIH customers\noperate 822 stores in approximately 60 countries.\nAce Retail Holdings LLC (\"ARH\") is the owner of the 180-store Westlake Ace Hardware (\"Westlake\") and the 79-store Great\nLakes Ace Hardware (\"GLA\") retail chains. As a result, the Company is also a retailer of hardware, paint and other related products.\nAce Wholesale Holdings LLC (\"A WH\") owns and operates Emery Jensen Distribution (\"EID\"). EID is a wholesaler of\nhardware, paint and other related products to non-member retailers.\nAce Services Holdings LLC (\"ASH\"), through its subsidiaries, operates Ace Hardware Home Services (\"AHHS\"), a provider\nof residential plumbing, heating, cooling and electric (\"PHCE\") services, and Ace Handyman Services, a franchisor of home\nimprovement, maintenance and repair services.\nWorldwide Store Count\nThe number of worldwide Ace retail outlets during the past three fiscal years is summarized as follows:\nFiscal Years\n2024 2023 2022\nR:.~~l outlets .at ~eginning of petj.od 5:,870 5,7.46 5,5.83\nNew retail outlets 230 222 232\nRetail _ou!let cancellation~ (l34} (98} (69)\nRetail outlets at end of period 5,966 5 870 5,746\n4934-4627-3032 (Ace Handyman - 1)",

In\n2024, the Company had an increase in wholesale merchandise revenues from new domestic Ace stores of$238.0 million. This increase\nwas partially offset by a decrease in wholesale merchandise revenues due to domestic Ace store cancellations of $32.9 million.

The wholesale gross\nmargin percentage was 13.4 percent of wholesale revenues in fiscal 2023, up from 12.0 percent in fiscal 2022.

The retail gross margin\npercentage was 45.3 percent of retail revenues in fiscal 2023, up from 44.9 percent in fiscal 2022. This increase in gross margin\npercentage primarily resulted from vendor funds earned related to new store openings.

The Company currently estimates that its cash flows from operating activities and working capital, together with its\nlines of credit, will be sufficient to fund its short-term liquidity needs. Actual liquidity and capital funding requirements depend on\nnumerous factors, including operating results, general economic conditions and the cost of capital.\nThe Company has a $1.1 billion line of credit facility. The facility is expandable to $1 .4 billion through a $300.0 million\naccordion that is exercisable without the consent of existing lenders provided that the Company is not in default of the credit agreement\nand further provided that none of the existing lenders are required to provide any portion of the increased facility. At the Company's\ndiscretion, borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate of either 25 to 100 basis points over the prime rate or 125 to 200\nbasis points over the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"), depending on the Company's leverage ratio. The credit facility was\npriced at SOFR plus 150 basis points at December 28, 2024. Fees on the unused portion of the line of credit range from 17.5 to 27.5\nbasis points depending on the Company's leverage ratio. The credit facility expires on January 24, 2028.

The $23.9 million decrease was driven by the $9.3 million decrease in net income and a\nnon-operating gain recognized in fiscal 2024.\nThe net change in assets and liabilities provided $114.6 million of cash in fiscal year 2024 compared to $93.6 million used in\nfiscal year 2023. The net change was driven by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses; partially offset by an increase in\naccounts receivable. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased $149. 7 million during fiscal 2024 compared to a decrease of\n$104.7 million during fiscal 2023. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was due to higher vendor purchases driven\nby higher sales volumes. Accounts receivable increased $78.5 million during fiscal 2024 compared to an increase of $55.4 million\nduring fiscal 2023. The higher increase in accounts receivable was due to higher sales volumes.\nNet cash used for investing activities was $222.8 million in fiscal 2024 compared to $502.3 million in fiscal 2023. Investing\nactivities in fiscal 2024 consisted of$ I 55.4 million in capital expenditures, $58.6 million paid to acquire businesses and a $37.3 million\nincrease in notes receivable for Retailer loan programs; partially offset by $22. 7 million of proceeds from the sale of the Company's\nRSC located in Little Rock, Arkansas. Investing activities in fiscal 2023 consisted of $309.7 million in cash paid for acquisitions to\nsupport the growth of the Ace Home Services business and $164.6 million in capital expenditures.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $320.9 million in fiscal 2024 compared to $141.9 million provided in fiscal 2023.\nDuring 2024, the Company paid $137.1 million for the cash portion of the 2023 patronage distribution, paid down borrowings under its\nrevolving credit facilities by $85.3 million, made principal payments on finance leases of$40.3 million, paid $22.9 million on patronage\nrefund certificates and made payments on long-term debt of $21.1 million. During 2023, the Company had $362.0 million of net\nborrowings under its revolving credit facilities, paid $ 133.1 million for the cash portion of the 2022 patronage distribution, made\nprincipal payments on finance leases of $28.3 million, paid $26. 7 million on patronage refund certificates and made payments on long\nterm debt of $17.8 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has certain other guarantees, as further described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Note\n12 - Commitments and Contingencies. The Company believes the likelihood of any such payment under these guarantees is remote.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing\nbasis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to\nbe reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and these estimates would vary under different\nassumptions or conditions. Management believes these estimates and assumptions are reasonable.\nThe Company annually reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that they\nprovide accurate and comprehensive information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company's significant\naccounting policies are described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following represents those critical\naccounting policies which involve a relatively higher degree of judgment, estimation and complexity and where materially different\namounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.\nValuation ofI nventories When necessary, the Company provides allowances to adjust the carrying value of inventories to the\nlower of cost or market, including costs to sell or dispose of surplus or damaged/obsolete inventory, and for estimated shrinkage.\nEstimates of the future demand for the Company's products are key factors used by management in assessing the net realizable value of\nthe inventories. While management believes that the estimates used are appropriate, an unanticipated decline in revenues at retail outlets\nor a significant decline in demand for products in selected product categories could result in valuation adjustments.\n4934-4627-3032 (Ace Handyman - 1)",

While management believes that the estimates used are appropriate, an unanticipated decline in revenues at retail outlets\nor a significant decline in demand for products in selected product categories could result in valuation adjustments.\n4934-4627-3032 (Ace Handyman - 1)\n\n\n\nVendor Funds The Company receives funds from vendors in the normal course of business principally as a result of purchase\nvolumes, revenues or promotions of vendors' products. Based on the provisions of the vendor agreements in place, management\ndevelops accrual rates by estimating the point at which the Company will have completed its performance under the agreement and the\namount agreed upon will be earned. Amounts accrued throughout the year can be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from\nprojected annual purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase\nvolumes are met. At year-end, the accrual reflects actual purchases made throughout the year.\nVendor funds are treated as a reduction of inventory cost, unless they represent a reimbursement of specific, incremental and\nidentifiable costs incurred by the customer to sell the vendor's product, in which case the costs would be netted. The majority of the\nvendor funds that the Company receives do not meet the specific, incremental and identifiable criteria. Therefore, the Company treats\na majority of these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory as the amounts are accrued and recognized as a reduction of cost of\nrevenues when the inventory is sold.\nAllowance for Expected Credit Losses The Company estimates an allowance for credit losses related to future expected losses\nby using relevant information such as historical collection statistics, current customer credit information, the current economic\nenvironment, the aging of receivables, the evaluation of compliance with lending covenants and the offsetting amounts due to Retailers\nfor stock, notes, interest and anticipated but unpaid patronage distributions. Significant past due accounts are reserved on a specific\nidentification basis. For the remainder of the accounts, the allowance is evaluated on a pool basis for accounts with similar risk\ncharacteristics and a loss-rate for each pool is determined using current conditions and historical credit loss statistics. The Company\nconsiders accounts and notes receivable past due if invoices remain unpaid past their due date and provides for the write-off of\nuncollectible receivables after exhausting all commercially reasonable collection efforts. While the Company believes it has\nappropriately considered known or expected outcomes, its customers' ability to pay their obligations, including those to the Company,\ncould be adversely affected by declining revenues at retail resulting from such factors as contraction in the economy or competitive\nconditions in the wholesale and retail industry including increased competition from omni-channel retailers, discount stores, chain stores\nand other mass merchandisers.\nInsurance Reserves Insurance reserves for claims related to the Company's self-insured property, general liability, workers'\ncompensation and auto liability insurance programs are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions\ninclude projected ultimate losses and confidence levels of the reserve requirement and consider historical loss levels and other factors.\nWhile management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual claims experience or changes in assumptions\nmay affect the Company's insurance reserves.\nGoodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired\nand identified intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level on an annual basis or\nmore frequently, if circumstances change or an event occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit\nbelow its carrying amount.\nQualitative factors may be assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is\nless than its carrying amount. If an election is made to not perform the qualitative assessment, or the qualitative assessment indicates\nthat the carrying amount is more likely than not higher than the fair value, goodwill is tested for impairment. If the fair value of a\nreporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying amount of a\nreporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nSignificant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment. This judgment includes developing cash flow\nprojections, selecting appropriate discount rates, identifying relevant market comparables, incorporating general economic and market\nconditions and selecting an appropriate control premium. The income approach is based on discounted cash flows, which are derived\nfrom internal forecasts and economic expectations for each respective reporting unit.\nThe Company tests reporting units for impairment annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events\nor circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. No goodwill\nimpairment charge was recorded during fiscal years 2024 and 2023.\nImpact of New Accounting Standards\nThere are no recently issued applicable accounting pronouncements that are not yet effective that are expected to have a material\nimpact on consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial condition, or consolidated cash flows.\nQualitative and Quantitative Disclosure About Market Risk\nInflation and Changes in Prices The Company's business is not generally governed by contracts that establish prices\nsubstantially in advance of the receipt of goods or services. As vendors increase or decrease their prices for merchandise supplied to\nthe Company, the Company generally increases or decreases the price to its customers in an equal amount plus the normal handling\ncharge on such amounts. The U.S. economy experienced a significant increase in inflation as the prices of raw materials and freight\nnegatively impacted the costs the Company pays to acquire products. For the most part, the Company was able to offset the effect of\nincreased costs by passing along cost increases to the Company's customers.

To manage customer credit risk, the Company monitors historical collection statistics, current retailer\ncredit information, the current economic environment, the aging of receivables, the evaluation of compliance with lending covenants\nand the offsetting amounts due to Retailers for stock, notes, interest and anticipated but unpaid patronage distributions. From certain\ncustomers, the Company also obtains collateral as considered necessary to reduce risk of loss. The Company does not believe the loss\nof any single customer would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.\nInterest Rate Volatility The Company has exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its floating rate debt. The Company\nbelieves that its exposure to interest rate fluctuations is not significant to its financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain Other Risks\nThe Company relies extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed or provided by third-party\nservice providers, to analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data. In managing the business, the Company also\nrelies heavily on the integrity of, security of and consistent access to this data for information such as customer data, merchandise\nplanning and inventory replenishment, supplier purchases, sales to Retailers, warehousing, distribution, inventory control, and various\ncorporate-level financial and other functions including communication with the Retailers. The Company's systems and the systems\nmanaged by third parties are subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power outages; computer and\ntelecommunications failures; computer viruses; security breaches or cyber-attacks. Although the Company and the third-party service\nproviders seek to maintain the Company's respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the\nintegrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, such efforts may not be successful. If the Company's or our service\nproviders' systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, this could significantly disrupt the Company's operations and\nbe costly, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy.\nThe Company and its third-party system providers receive, collect and store personally identifiable, confidential, proprietary\nand other information from our vendors, customers and employees so that they may, among other things, purchase products or services\nand enroll in promotional programs. Any breach of the Company's or its third-party system providers' security could result in significant\ncosts to protect any customers, vendors, employees, and other parties whose personal data is compromised. Loss of customer, supplier,\nemployee or other business information could disrupt operations, damage the Company's reputation and expose the Company to claims\nfrom customers, vendors, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees and others, any of which could have\na material adverse effect on the Company, its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company imports inventory from manufacturers outside the United States, particularly in Asia. Importing involves risks\nincluding duties, tariffs, quotas on imported merchandise and potential disruptions resulting from geopolitical problems in countries\nfrom which merchandise is imported. Our ability to manage the importing of goods from overseas, their production, timing of deliveries\nand U.S. Customs-related compliance is an important component of our merchandising strategy. Geopolitical issues and military\nconflicts outside of the United States may increase the likelihood of supply chain interruptions and have a negative impact on our import\nactivities.\nThe Company continues to monitor these market forces and risks but cannot reasonably predict the long-term impacts of these\nevolving developments.\nDisclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis document includes certain forward-looking statements about the expectations of the Company. Although the Company\nbelieves these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, actual results may vary materially from stated expectations. Such\nforward-looking statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\"\n\"intend,\" \"may,\" \"planned,\" \"potential,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"project,\" \"estimate,\" \"ultimate,\" or similar phrases.
